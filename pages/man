*NAME*
        man - view a man page

*SYNOPSIS*
        man ENTRY

*DESCRIPTION*
        Will display a man page located in /usr/man or MANPATH env variable
        If MANPAGER env variable is defined it will invoke that instead
        MANPAGER is useful if you want to have it display like the less command
        
        If MANPAGER is not defined man will try its best to display it
        Links cannot be displayed well and cannot be interacted with
        \~C, \~R and \^L currently do not support modifiers inside of them

        Heres the modifiers you can use in man pages. You can also find these in OS_CONVENTIONS.md:

        \@b = @bblack@0 (black)    \@R = @Rred@0    \@G = @Ggreen@0    \@Y = @Yyellow@0    \@B = @Bblue@0
        \@M = @Mmagenta@0          \@C = @Ccyan@0   \@W = @Wwhite@0    \@0 = reset
        
        With \* = Bright*
        \@b = @bblack@0            \@R = @Rred@0    \@G = @Ggreen@0    \@Y = @Yyellow@0    \@B = @Bblue@0
        \@M = @Mmagenta@0          \@C = @Ccyan@0   \@W = @Wwhite@0*
        
        *@RR@YA@GI@BN@MB@bO@CW@0*
        Escape with \\: \\\@M
        \~C = ~CCentered
        \~R = ~RRight
        \^Ltitle\^Lurl\^L = ^Ltitle^Lurl^L (links)
